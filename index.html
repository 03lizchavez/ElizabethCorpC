            <p>In this screenshot, the image says ", This <strong>conspiracy</strong> did not give
                this matter proper attention." speaking about a failed attempt on Hitler's life.

            <p> In this image the line says ", President John F. Kennedy's assasination resulted
                from a <strong>conspiracy</strong>, or as believed so. </p>

            <h2>Comparison &amp; Differences</h2>
            <p> These 2 different files (listed below) are being compared from a couple of common
                frequencies. They share common ground in repeated frequencies in the word
                "assasination" and "conspiracy" and a couple other words but the focus for today
                will be the word "conspiracy". In one text, it's believed that the assasination of
                President JFK was a conspiracyn and probably Lee Harvey Oswald was the conspirator.
                Though it is saying there's not evidence to conspiracy, there's a very long finger
                being pointed to an ex-marine. Which brings the other text file in. They bring up
                before the highlighted quote, that it takes one who isn't emotionally "unstrung" or
                at least is sure enough to commit something so serious. Since Oswald was an
                ex-marine, he was definitely trained to handle himself and be serious about
                situations like these. Not only that but he probably was emotionally unstrung
                because of how common ptsd is for military members, ex or active. Although one text
                is pretty much the guide to assasination and the other is a conspiracy theory on
                JFK's assasination, they kind of go together yet still some differences in it. </p>
