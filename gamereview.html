        <h2>The Good People</h2>
        <img src="YRMYWf.jpg" alt="The Good People" width="200"
            height="150"/>
        <div><p style="font-size:25px"><h3>Summary</h3>The game I chose to play was called "The
            Good People". It starts of with a couple together who visit, the narrator, Daniel's
            family's old village. Daniel and Alice don't appear to be the stereoypical couple often
            seem nowadays. Daniel also appears to have a love-hate relationship with his father and
            not much is said about his mother and mainly focused on his grandfather </div>
        <div><p style="font-size:25px"><h3>Empty Space</h3><img
            src="Screenshot2023-12-12at1.13.07PM.png" alt="Screenshot1" width="500"
            height="275" id="empty" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"/> In this screenshot I had taken, it was clear that one the left side,
            it's completely blank. Prior to that, it had other options to continue of as it normally
            does on some words so more context can be given. It seems like it might've been an
            accident to make the text and options disappear. </div>
        <div><p style="font-size:25px"><h3>Tilted Text</h3><p><img
                    src="Screenshot2023-12-12at5.29.22PM.png" alt="Screenshot2" width="500"
                    height="275" id="crooked" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" /></p> The setting switches as Daniel goes back to one
            of his memories which then lead to his current setting and time but the layout of the
            text changes. It goes from straight lines to crooked. I think it was changed to that
            because the creator wanted to make the scene more eerie. I think if they included more
            images and not just sometimes, or even an animation or noise, it would help create that
            image. It is slightly confusing and I'm not sure if I understood correctly either. </div>
        <div><p style="font-size:50px"> <h3>Unknown Creature</h3>
            <p><img src="Screenshot2023-12-12at5.29.41PM.png" alt="Screenshot3" width="500"
                height="275" id="creature" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"/></p> I do find it cool that they included text that
            constantly change and unreadable. I am not sure how to do that so I definitely think
            it's really cool to include that. I feel like it was given more effort just by including
            that. I do feel like this made the story take a turn and introduce fear into the mix of
            suspense and mystery. However, I'd like to know more backstory to this creature. Like
            will the name ever be revealed or will it never come to light? I feel like more context
            to the creature should've been given because it left me confused as to what's really
            going on aside from saying that he's hungry and it was representing what was once a
            populated village to a deserted village.</div>
