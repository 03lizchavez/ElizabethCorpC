        <h2>The Good People</h2>
        <img src="YRMYWf.jpg" alt="The Good People" width="300" height="250" />
        <p style="font-size:18px">I chose "The Good People" because it sounded like might be a game
            that will have quite a bit of confusion and wondering. There were some parts, mainly in
            the beginning of the game where it was like okay I get the point but what's the
            backstory? Not sure if that's me being impatient or that's something other players have
            experienced themselves. Like with the game, I feel like context should be provided to
            the characters because it's confusing as to what's going on and can make the player(s)
            not want to continue trying to figure out a backstory or context of something dragged
            out. I do wonder if some options are important to click on or will you recieve the same
            outcome. I think this game was supposed to build up suspense but honestly, with a little
            more backstory, it might keep the player interested. Extra changes </p>
